# PyBer_Analysis

This data was to show the progress of building a visual represenations. There was a DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week. These showed that the majority of the income comes from Urban areas. There also seems like there are , on average, two rides per driver a day. This shows that ,per driver Rural makes more money at around $100 a day when Urban makes around $30.

I had a lot of trouble screating the summary for the dataframe. I reread and looked at the old module. I think its best to keep examples of all the different type of tables and charts to be able to refence back to. That way it is easier to remember what you already learned.

I would recommoned to invest more in urban areas since there is a much larger demand. That means having a larger number of driver stationed in specific areas with a small range. 
I feel like they should have also taken the distance traveled to be able to see how much money they got on average by mile. They should have also taken average time since urban areas could be shorter distances but the same amount of time because of traffic. Checking how much money you make on an average hour could also be important.
